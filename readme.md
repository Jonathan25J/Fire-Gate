# Fire Gate
With the Fire Gate Discord app is it possible to communicatie anonymously with other Discord users. The only limitation is that users can only communicatie with other users who have this app in common.

## Example
People can communicate with each other through entities known as spirits. Everyone can create an unlimited amount of spirits and the owners of these spirits remain anonymous. These spirits gather at custom made gates or go trough the Fire Gate.

### Fire Gate
For instance, `User 1` can talk with `User 2` by using their spirit named `Water`. The spirit `Water` can directly message `User 2`. `User 2` can respond by creating their own spirit, in this case the spirit is named `Fire`. The spirit `Fire` sends a message to the spirit `Water`, which can then directly respond to it.

In this scenario `User 1` knows that the spirit `Fire` belongs to `User 2`, because `User 2` replied using the `Fire` spirit, but `User 2` doesn't know the `Water` spirit is from `User 1`. It's possible to stay both anonymous if you don't make it obvious who's spirit it is from.
